# Unicode Converter

As a partial fulfillment to CSARCH2, this repository was created to serve as the official repository for the final group project for the course. The project will serve as a culmination of the lessons covered in this course, specifically the character representation through Unicode encoding.

The goal of the project is to create an application that is capable of turning a Unicode value into its equivalent UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 value.

## Output:
[https://ascii-converter.vercel.app/](https://ascii-converter.vercel.app/)

## Specifications:
1. Input: Unicode (with invalid Unicode check)
2. Output: UTF-8; UTF-16; UTF-32 (format: xx xx xx ; where x is hex nibble)
3. Note: output with option to paste result in notepad

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## To run locally, you must install:
